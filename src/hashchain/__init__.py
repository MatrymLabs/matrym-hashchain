"""A tamper-evident, append-only, hash-chained ledger. Dependency-free (stdlib only).

Each entry carries a sha256 over its own payload AND the previous entry's hash, so any later edit,
reorder, or removal of a PAST record is detected the next time the log is read. A file-simple,
zero-dependency primitive for audit trails, transaction logs, and chain-of-custody records.

    from pathlib import Path
    from hashchain import append, read, verify

    p = Path("audit.jsonl")
    append(p, {"event": "created", "who": "alice"})
    append(p, {"event": "approved", "who": "bob"})
    verify(p)   # True -- the history reads clean end to end

Honest bounds -- this proves INTEGRITY, not everything:
- Detected: a changed payload (hash mismatch), a reordered or inserted record, a deleted MIDDLE
  record (the next record's prior-hash no longer links).
- NOT detected by the chain alone: dropping the LAST record(s) -- anchor the head hash elsewhere
  (a receipt, a second store) if truncation must be caught. And integrity is not authenticity:
  sign the head hash to prove WHO wrote it.
Any break fails loud with `HashChainError` rather than returning a dishonest history.

Provenance: this is a MatrymLabs Hardware Store part -- a pattern first proven in the CodeForge MUD
engine (the "Chronicle", the game's tamper-evident memory) and reused across the fleet (a federal
guidance-check ledger; an AI-triage decision audit trail). Published standalone so any project can
reuse the same tested primitive.
